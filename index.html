        <p>The path follows an invisible grid and the rhythm of "pixels".</p>

    <div id="story">
      <p>In November 2022 R. and I visited <span>Anni and Josef Albers</span> exhibition at Kunstmuseum Den Haag.
      </p>
      <p>Following Anni and Josef Arnolds's vision as art teachers, Kunstmuseum suggested the visitors <span>open their eyes</span>
        and share a personal observation of one of the works from the exhibition.
      </p>
      <p>Standing before the <span>Red Meander by Anni Arnolds</span>, I had an impression of a moving picture.
      The squares formed by the superposition of consequent prints seemed to blink and reminded me of a glitch or pixels.
      Meanwhile, the title "meander" evoked a labyrinth -something more solid- or a path - dynamic, interweaving, evolving.</p> 
      <p>As a result, I coded this little sketch with a blinking background where you can create, draw, walk your own meander.
      As an almost meditative exercise, it reflects the idea of an "aimless wander" and experimentation.
